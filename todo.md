  * Inspiration: I am tired of vector editors taking focus out of vector editing. It just needs to do main things simply: I don't need layouts, flow, interactions etc. Just vector graphics in its purest. Just edit SVG in-place, in most inspiring and efficient way.
  * Good color picker (lch) - not looking palettes elsewhere
  * Font picker: knowing fonts / matches / suggestions
  * Text transforms like kittl, curve etc
  * Free transform, skew, perspective
  * No cloud, save files locally as SVG
  * Symmetry for patterns / mandalas
  * Built-in image tracing
  * Pixel layers: merge, paint, inverse (core of photopea)
  * procedural bgs with randomization (plugin?)
  * multiple strokes/outlines
  * Images filters: like pxlr
  * vector network wo bugs
